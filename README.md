# Rubiks_Cube_Solver
Got bored when studying for finals, played with some Rubik's Cubes that I have, and realized I should make this. I'll also use this as a way to use some of the C++ I've been learning.

The goal of this program will be to solve any nxn Rubik's cub in a reasonable amount of time. More specifically, this means being able to solve a randomized 3x3 Rubik's cube in 20 moves or less (20 is the maximum number of moves required to solve any 3x3 Rubik's cube).

For the 3x3 cube solver, I mostly used the work of Kociemba. This is mostly just because he has great documentation on his website, and I think the way he represents the cube is pretty good.
